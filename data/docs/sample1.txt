OSS RAG Lab is a demo project that showcases retrieval augmented generation using
only local, open-source tooling such as Ollama and LangChain.

It supports multiple pipelines:
- BM25 lexical retrieval
- Vector retrieval using local embeddings
- A hybrid of both approaches

The system also collects user feedback on answer quality and exposes simple metrics.
